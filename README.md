# 📘 Smart Contracts in Rust with Soroban (Stellar)

This repository contains a collection of **practical examples and explanations** of smart contracts written in **Rust** using **Soroban**, the smart contract framework for the **Stellar** network.

The goal is to create a sort of _hands-on class_ where each contract is explained in detail, along with its logic and how to use it. It's ideal for those who want to start building on Soroban or strengthen their existing knowledge.

## 🚀 What you'll find here

- Smart contracts written in Rust for Soroban.
- Commented code with detailed explanations.
- Real use cases and educational examples.
- Each topic or feature in its own folder.

## 🧱 Repository structure

```
/- LearningStellarContracts
├ LearningContracts
├── 01-contract-name/

│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── README.md (detailed explanation)
├── 02-another-contract/
│   └── ...
└── README.md (this file)
```

Each folder contains an independent contract, with its own code and explanation.

## 🔧 Requirements

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Smart Contracts Stellar Documentation](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build)

## 🏁 How to use the contracts

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LearningStellarContracts.git

   cd LearningStellarContracts
   ```
2. Navigate into the folder of the contract you want to explore.
3. Follow the instructions in that contract’s `Makefile` to build, deploy, and test it.
